#Introduction
Austin, Texas is known for being an incredibly dog friendly city and there are many people who include their dogs in their day-to-day activities. It isn’t unusual to see people eating at a restaurant with their dog lying down by their feet or walking with their owners through the aisles of a grocery store. While seeing dogs and their owners almost everywhere may be a common occurrence in the city of Austin, the act of being active with your dog is also a great way to stay healthy and in shape anywhere. 

This application will encourage that by allowing dog owners to keep track of activities they take with their dog. 

Users will be able to register an account with this website. Once an account has been established with a username and password, the user will have the capability to enter various pieces of information relating to their dog and the activities they take. Such deliverables include:
--Name of their dog(s)
--Activity they took with their dog 
--If applicable, which dog they took on the activity
--Date of the activity
--Location of activity
--Start and end points of their walk (if applicable)
--Distance they walked (if applicable)
--Difficulty level (If applicable, ex. hiked a mid-level trail)
--Time they started
--Time they ended
--Weather condition
--Notes 

Ideally, users will have the capability to create unique entries relating to the activity they shared with their dog. Each unique entry will include sub entries that allow the user to enter information based on the activity of the parent entry. For example, the user creates an entry for a walk they took with their dog. Under the initial walk entry, they can add detailed information pertaining to the activity and further sub entries for any walks they take in the future. This allows the user to keep their entry logs categorized by activity. 

Users will also be able to see a summarized page that details information based on their entries. The information will include a combined list of all activities they took with their dog for which they will be allowed to retrieve information based on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis.  They can further analyze their summaries based on activity and which dog (if applicable) among other capabilities. 

This application isn’t a shared application where users can see other users. It is largely a personal tracker for each user to use as they see fit. So each unique user will be the administrator for their own account. Users will be able to edit, delete, and add more information to their entries if necessary.
